Dabbling in the Fake News Challenge (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/)

Download the `word2vec` [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/) trained on Google News corpus. The file `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin` has to be present in this directory.

The dataset is in the google drive folder `fake-news-challenge`.  There are three parts: feature_pkl folder, fnc-1 folder and related_data.pkl. Just download and put them in the same directory as the project.
